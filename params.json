Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options for HTTP(S)\r\n\r\n* `follow`    (boolean)   Follow redirects. Defaults to `true`.\r\n* `gzip`      (boolean)   If the request should be attempted with gzip. Defaults to `true` if the [node-compress module](https://github.com/waveto/node-compress) is available.\r\n* `headers`   (object)    Headers to pass along with the HTTP request.\r\n* `method`    (string)    HTTP request method. Default 'GET'.\r\n* `body`      (readablestream|string|buffer) A body of data to pass with the request.\r\n* `key`       (string)    (HTTPS Only) Private key to use for SSL. Defaults to ENV var `NODE_HTTPS_KEY` or attempts to find it as \"./key.pem\".\r\n* `cert`      (string)    (HTTPS Only) Public x509 certificate to use. Defaults to ENV var NODE_HTTPS_CERT or attempts to find it as \"./cert.pem\".\r\n* `ca`        (string|array) (HTTPS Only) An authority certificate or array of authority certificates to check the remote host against.\r\n\r\n### Options for file\r\n\r\n* `encoding`  (string) The encoding of the file to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Options for FTP\r\n\r\n* `anonymous` (boolean) If no user info is in the URI, add anonymous. Defaults to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\n### 0.4.1\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Added `buffer`-option to file and ftp schemes.\r\n* [Change] Updated mime dependency to 1.2.5.\r\n\r\n### 0.4.0\r\n\r\n* [Change] Added the `buffer` option, which is an inverted `stream`, which is now deprecated. \r\n* [Fix] Avoid a global variable (by [senorpedro](https://github.com/senorpedro/))\r\n* [Fix] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Only 301, 302 and 307 is proper statusCodes for redirects.\r\n\r\n### 0.3.5\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Use Buffer.byteLength(body) only on strings, and body.length on Buffers.\r\n* [Fix] Support for broken redirect implementations that give relative Location: headers.\r\n\r\n### 0.3.4\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Use Buffer.byteLength(body) for Content-Length header as well, it's just better (and fixes a bug where the body was cut off).\r\n\r\n### 0.3.3\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Avoid 'Out of bounds'-errors by using Buffer.byteLength(chunk) instead of chunk.length.\r\n\r\n### 0.3.2\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Errors was being thrown when using userinfo in HTTP uris.\r\n\r\n### 0.3.1\r\n\r\n* [Fix] Updated `addressable` dependency to 0.3.3. Now both addressable.URI and Nodes built-in URL objects are valid as the `uri` argument.\r\n* [Fix] Fixed error thrown when an error occurs in utils.buffer().\r\n\r\n### 0.3.0\r\n\r\n* [Feature] Updated `addressable` dependency to 0.3.1.\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _HTTPS_ Added key and certificate parsing.\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Added a `method` option can be used if anything other than GET is desired.\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _HTTP_/_HTTPS_ Added a `body` options for passing a payload with the request. Can be either a ReadableStream, a String or a Buffer.\r\n\r\n### 0.2.2\r\n\r\n* [Feature] Re-factored the schemes into separate files. Now adding more schemes will be much easier.\r\n\r\n* [Feature] Added a simple binary. Usage: `open-uri http://google.com`\r\n\r\n* [Fix] _FTP_ is now closing properly when completed or failed.\r\n\r\n### 0.2.1\r\n\r\n* [Feature] Better parsing of content using the [mime module](https://github.com/bentomas/node-mime) for Content-Type lookup.\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _FTP_ Initial support using the [node-ftp module](https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.2.0\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _HTTP(S)_ Now supports gzip responses (and adds a 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'-header if there is none already).\r\n\r\n* [Feature] _HTTP(S)_ Now decodes JSON if response is of 'Content-Type: application/json'.\r\n\r\n* [Fix] _HTTP(S)_ Fixed an issue with redirects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 0.1.0\r\n\r\n* Initial version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n*  _HTTP(S)_ Support older versions of Node? Currently only support 0.3.6 and up (because of the new HTTP Client API).\r\n\r\n*  _HTTP(S)_ Proxy support.\r\n\r\n*  _FTP_ Listing files (when uri.pathname ends with \"/\")\r\n\r\n*  _FTP_ Uploading files (when opts.body is passed)\r\n\r\n* A timeout option for all schemes would be useful.\r\n\r\n* A binary, just for fun really. Usage: `open-uri http://google.com`. \r\n  - Output to process.stdout by default. \r\n  - Allow a REST interface? So if something is written to stdin it's sent as body to the url using POST by default, but definable with -X (curl style!)\r\n  - Pass command line arguments as options to the scheme functions. Ex. `open-uri -gzip http://google.com` sets opts.gzip to true.\r\n\r\n* More schemes support? Suggestions?\r\n  - Support for opening a file descriptor? Basically a shortcut for fs.readFile(fd).\r\n  - S3 (using [knox module](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox)), should list objects when path ends with \"/\"\r\n  - NNTP (using [node-nntp module](https://github.com/mscdex/node-nntp))\r\n  - IRC (using [node-irc module](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc)), open(\"irc://bot@chat.freenode.net/nodejs\") -> callback for each message? with a say function in the callback? ex: `function(err,from,to,msg,say){ if( to == \"bot\" && ~msg.indexOf(\"hello\") ){ say(from+\": HI!\") } }` `this` could be the irc object so the socket can be closed...\r\n  - SQL query. Is there a standard URI for this? Something like: `mysql://root@localhost/mydb?query=SELECT * FROM x;` or `sqlite3://file.sqlite?query=SELECT * FROM x;` possibly with support for input escaping. open(\"sqlite3://file.sqlite?query=SELECT * FROM x WHERE id=? AND name=?;\",[12,\"bob\"]) using the drivers own escaping. With a callback like `function(err,rows,meta){}`.\r\n\r\n## Thanks to\r\n\r\n* [Mikeal Rogers](https://github.com/mikeal), for his excellent [request module](https://github.com/mikeal/request/).\r\n\r\n* [TJ Holowaychuck](https://github.com/visionmedia), for his minimalist projects inspiring this little tool.\r\n\r\n* [Brian White](https://github.com/mscdex), for [ftp](https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp) and [nntp](https://github.com/mscdex/node-nntp) modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Robert Sk&ouml;ld &lt;robert@publicclass.se&gt;\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","name":"OpenURI","google":""}
