# Asynchronous Open URI

  A CommonJS module inspired by Rubys Open-URI library.


## Install

  It's available on npm, so a simple `npm install open-uri` should be enough.


## Usage

	var open = require("open-uri");

	// Get a website
	open("http://google.com",function(err,google){console.log(google)})

	// Get a file
	open("/var/log/system.log",function(err,log){console.log(log)})

	// Stream a file to STDOUT
	open("file:///var/log/system.log",process.stdout)

	// Stream a website to a file
	var file = require("fs").createWriteStream("/tmp/goog.html")
	open("https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=open+uri",file)

	// Chain it 
	open("http://google.com",console.log)("http://publicclass.se",process.stdout)
